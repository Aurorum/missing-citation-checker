# Missing Citation Checker

**Missing Citation Checker** is a simple Google Docs add-on that scans a document to ensure that the in-text citations and the final reference list align. In other words, no more submitting an essay then realising that a citation didn't make it into your bibliography!

## Instructions

1. Write your essay and include your bibliography and reference list in the same document.  
2. Navigate to `Extensions > Check citations`.  
3. The tool will inform you if any citations are missing.

#### Example

> “Tony Blair (2010: 268) writes that ‘criminal justice was altogether a different bag of nails’ — an analysis supported by numerous scholars (Rowling 2002; Sinja et al. 2010).”
>
> **References:**
>
> - Blair, T. (2010). *A Journey*. Penguin Books: London.  
> - Rowling, M. (2002). ‘Analysis of Criminal Justice Policy’, *Law Review*, 23(2), pp. 220–234.


In this scenario, **“Sinja et al. 2010”** would be flagged as an incomplete entry because it is an in-text citation excluded from the final reference list. The tool’s purpose is not to correct the bibliography, but simply to identify such issues which can be manually addressed by the author.
